# Python Coursework â€“ University

## Description
This repository contains Python coursework completed during my university course. It covers core Python concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP). The coursework includes hands-on projects involving Python's built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets, and explores the fundamentals of writing classes and functions. A key addition is an HTML parser, which demonstrates working with web data.
